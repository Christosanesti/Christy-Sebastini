# UX Design Specification - Michelle Portfolio

## Executive Summary

### Project Vision

A single professional portfolio for Christy Sebastini that replaces scattered links and documents with one cohesive, reference-tier presence. Visitors (recruiters, hiring managers, potential clients) quickly understand who she is, see proof of experience and credibility, and can reach her—without confusion or dead ends. The experience balances fast scan (recruiter) with deeper exploration (hiring manager), and supports optional 3D/motion and strong visual hierarchy within accessibility and performance constraints.

### Target Users

- **Recruiters / HR (primary):** Time-poor; need "who she is, what she's done, can I trust it?" and a clear Contact/CTA in under a minute. Often on mobile or shared links.
- **Hiring managers / potential clients (primary):** Want context, role, and outcomes per project; may open recommendations or attestations. Need enough evidence to decide "worth a call" or "bookmark for later."
- **Christy (site owner):** Wants the site to stay current; MVP = manual updates by you; Growth = optional CMS or structured content flow.

### Key Design Challenges

- **First-screen clarity:** Hero and hierarchy must answer "who + what + trust" quickly for recruiters.
- **Two modes in one site:** Support both fast scan and deeper project/recommendation exploration without overwhelming or hiding the CTA.
- **Reference-tier + inclusive:** Strong layout and optional 3D/motion must not block content; respect reduced motion and WCAG 2.1 AA.

### Design Opportunities

- **3D/motion:** Use for hero or key sections to differentiate while keeping core content and performance safe.
- **Information architecture:** Clear, consistent nav and sections so "Projects," "Recommendations," and "Contact" are obvious from any page.
- **Credibility in context:** Surface recommendations, attestations, and project assets (per PRD Assets inventory) where they support trust and depth.
